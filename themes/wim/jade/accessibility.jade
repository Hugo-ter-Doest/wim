          p Web Accessibility is about allowing people with and without disabilities to have access to the information they want and need from your website. With reports of 1 in 5 people in North America claiming some sort of disability, 20% of the population is just too large of a group to ignore. Siteimprove Accessibility gives you a complete overview of your siteâ€™s web accessibility issues, plus clear explanations of how they affect your users, and specific recommendations on how to fix them.
