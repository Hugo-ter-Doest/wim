       | We set up the current theme architecture to provide maximal flexibility and sustainability for future theme developers. We use Bootstrap to provide an accessible and robust front-end, but we only compile the Bootstrap css that we actually need in the wimbase theme. You can choose to make use of our default WIM theme or pick one of the  approaches that fits your needs. Read the guidelines carefully to make sure you gain all the advantages of future distribution updates.

      ol
       li Navigate to the root of the wim theme
      pre.
        $ cd profiles/wim/themes/wim/
      ol(start='2')
       li Install packages
      pre.
        $ npm install
      ol(start='3')
       li Run gulp watch task that will compile your css
      pre.
        $ gulp
      ol(start='4')
       li Change variables in _theme.scss
      pre.
        $ open components/_theme.scss
      p
       strong Notes:
       |  New WIM releases will come with a newly compiled CSS file. You need to recompile the CSS with gulp after merging the latest code, so your custom variables are implemented again.
