* ADD YOUR CUSTOM STYLES HERE!
*
* 1. It is forbidden to use !important. Try to use the proper selectors to target your elements:)
* 2. When you update WIM, run 'npm install' afterwards to make sure you have the latest dependencies.
* 3. Don't modify files outside of the '/components/css/theme' folder. Otherwise you will break the update path.
* 4. Check the gulptasks for an understanding of how to syntax your files. Use the _ prefix for @imports in
*    this file. E.g. '@import _navbar.scss' will NOT be compiled seperately as '/css/navbar.css', but included in '/css/style.css'.
* 4. Keep your SCSS base structured and organised and have fun!
